1) During trace file gathering:
   Read a file which controls what gets output:
   a)  Check the environment variable DUMPI_CONF for a file name (path)
   b)  Check the current working directory for a file named dumpi.conf
   c)  Fall back on some reasonable defaults.

1b) During trace gathering:
    Ways of turning profiling on and off at given times.
    - Timestamp? (at runtime xxx) -- could be problematic
    - Given MPI call (at first MPI_xxx)
    - Call-in methods for instrumenting application code.

Need to decide how we handle storing (or not storing) papi parameters.

2) During or after trace file gathering:
   Utility to output summary of MPI functions called (counts etc.),
   configuration parameters used for a given trace file run, etc.
   Q:  Should we gather statistics on functions that are not explicitly traced
       (e.g. how often was MPI_Iprobe called, even if MPI_Iprobe was ignored).

3) During trace file parsing:
   Move to callback-based parsing (undefined callbacks result
   in associated MPI events being ignored).
     typedef void (*sendfun_t)(const dumpi_sendprm *, const dumpi_papiprm *);
     typedaef void (*isendfun_t)(const dumpi_isendprm *, const dumpi_papiprm *);
     ...
     void get_send(sendfun_t);
     void get_isend(isendfun_t);
     ...

4) Statistics gathering:  Keep separate track of ignored and retreived 
   MPI calls (e.g. Iprobe).

---------------------------------------------------------------

Make header record a variable-length key/value record (to allow
storing node names, indices, etc.).

Use zlib to compress the MPI call stream.

Add an index record to the end of the file (to be read via fseek to
the end of the file):
fpos Header record start
fpos Header record end
fpos Stream record start
<possibly epoch count/locations>
fpos Stream record end
fpos Footer record start
fpos Footer record end


Add DUMPI_ANY_TAG and DUMPI_ANY_SOURCE (and associated testing).


--------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT:  Parse routines must take an additional (user) argument
to differentiate between different parsers in the same address space.

Suggested additions to the header record (fixed width):

Hostname
User name (or user id?)
Date/time

----

Add autoconf tests for

DUMPI_ON_REDSTORM
DUMPI_HAS_PAPI


------------------------

KNOWN POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

Allgatherv:  displacement arrays etc. are only required to be valid at root
(several other functions in the same category).


-----------------------------

Current work:

Fix up CSTRING and NULLTERM handing for MPIBINDINGS (getting closer to compiling).
